## Task 1: software configuration.
### Subtask 1: Why did I choose to participate in the Dare IT Challenge?
Hello. My name is Elvira. And first of all, I take part in this project because I really like to learn something new for myself and test my abilities. 
I also like to find bugs and their causes in applications. 
I like to solve complex tasks and work in a team, this is a plus of this challenge for me, since it is easier to solve something complex collectively. 
Teamwork motivates me. My goal is to gain and use skills in using tools for automated testing, as well as communication with like-minded people.

I wish myself and everyone involved in this challenge good luck. And thanks to all the mentors.
